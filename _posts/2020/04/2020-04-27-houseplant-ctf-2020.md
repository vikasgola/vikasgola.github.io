    solution="
Given webpage takes input and generates a qr code of that.
Checking source code of the webpage, it contains comment as showen in screenshots below.

After some testing, input *backtick* gives a qr code which says *error*.
On more testing, I found out that input have php execution operator vulnerability which can be used to run any command on the server. However, webpage only have output window of 1 char.
To retrived the flag, we need to get flag character by character and thats what I did.

```
`cat flag.txt | cut -c NTH_CHAR`
```

Contains a function *check* in the code. We need to reverse it to get the flag.
I made reverse of the check function with name *revchek* which prints the flag.

Flag was distributed in if conditions started at 3rd line.
Just combining them will give the flag.

flag is xored with key 'meownyameownyameownyameownyameownya' and stored as base64 encoded string.

So, decoding base64 and xor output with key gives the flag.

flag is xored with rot_13 of key 'meownyameownyameownyameownyameownya', and then output is encoded with base64 and then output is encoded with rot_13.

Just reverse it.

So, decode rot_13, then decode base64, then xor output with rot_13 of the key gives the flag.
